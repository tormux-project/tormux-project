## Termux Properties

The Termux terminal can be configured by editing the `~/.termux/termux.properties` file. This file uses a simple key=value property syntax.

Lines beginning with # are comments and do not get executed. Most of the properties are included as comments in the file. Uncomment an existing line or add a new line to configure a property.

For changes to take effect after editing the properties file, either execute termux-reload-settings or restart Termux by closing all sessions and starting the application again.
