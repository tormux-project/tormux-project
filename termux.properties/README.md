# Termux Properties

The Termux terminal can be configured by editing the `~/.termux/termux.properties` file. This file uses a simple _key=value_ property syntax.

Lines beginning with # are comments and do not get executed. Most of the properties are included as comments in the file. Uncomment an existing line or add a new line to configure a property.

For changes to take effect after editing the properties file, either execute `termux-reload-settings` or restart Termux by closing all sessions and starting the application again.

This file is useful for `additional key settings`, such as displaying up and down arrows etc.
